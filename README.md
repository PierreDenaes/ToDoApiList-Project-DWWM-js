## Overview

Todo API is a robust and scalable Node.js application designed for managing tasks efficiently. It provides a comprehensive set of features for task management, including adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving tasks, as well as managing task statuses and archiving completed tasks.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, update, and delete tasks.
- **Status Updates**: Change the status of each task (e.g., 'doing', 'done').
- **Task Archiving**: Archive completed tasks for future reference.
- **Secure Access**: HTTPS setup for secure communication.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm installed on your system.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PierreDenaes/ToDoApiList-Project-DWWM-js.git
cd todoapi
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Local SSL Certificate Creation

For development purposes, you might want to create a self-signed SSL certificate to enable HTTPS on your local server. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have OpenSSL installed on your system. It usually comes pre-installed on MacOS and Linux. For Windows, you might need to install it separately.

### Generating SSL Certificate

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt** and navigate to your project directory.

2. **Run the OpenSSL command** to generate a private key and a certificate:

   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
   ````

    - `x509`: This option specifies the creation of a self-signed certificate.

    - `newkey rsa:4096`: Creates a new certificate request along with a new private key. The `rsa:4096` denotes a 4096-bit RSA key.

    - `keyout`: Specifies the filename for the newly created private key. Example filename: `key.pem`.

    - `out`: Specifies the filename for the certificate. Example filename: `cert.pem`.

    - `days`: The validity period of the certificate. For example, `365` days denotes one year.

3. **Complete the Certificate Creation**:
   - Follow the prompts to input details like country code, state, and organization. These fields can be left blank for local development purposes.

### Note

While self-signed SSL certificates are suitable for development environments, they should not be used in production. For production environments, obtain a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

## Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a '.env' file in the root directory of the project and define your environment variables:

```javascript
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=yourUsername
DB_PASSWORD=yourPassword
DB_DATABASE=todolist
DB_PORT=3306 /*(8889 -> Mac)*/
SSL_KEY_PATH=path/to/your/key.pem
SSL_CERT_PATH=path/to/your/cert.pem
```

1. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Modify your `.env` file with the paths to your newly created `key.pem` and `cert.pem` files, as described in the 'Set Up Environment Variables' section.

## Step 5: Run the Application

Start the server.js

```bash
node server.js
````

## API Endpoints

The Todo API provides various endpoints to manage tasks, statuses, and archived tasks. Below is a list of available endpoints and their functionalities:

### Task Endpoints

- **PATCH `/tasks/:id/status`**: Update the status of a task.
  - Body Parameters: `status_idstatus`
- **PATCH `/tasks/:id/archived`**: Archive a task.
  - Body Parameters: `isFinished`
- **GET `/tasks/:id`**: Fetch a single task by its ID.
- **GET `/tasks/doing`**: Fetch tasks that are currently in progress.
- **POST `/tasks/archived/:id`**: Add a task to the archived list.

### Status Endpoints

- **GET `/status`**: Fetch all status labels.
- **POST `/status`**: Add a new status label.
  - Body Parameters: `labelStatus`
- **PUT `/status/:id`**: Update a status label by its ID.
  - Body Parameters: `labelStatus`
